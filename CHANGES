Changes in 0.5.0
----------------

- Simplified interface to CPU module.
- DIRECT_VIDEO now works with PMG collision detection. This option increases
  performance by about 28% but can result in different colours being displayed.
  This is because this option relies on COLPF0, COLPF1, COLPF2, COLPF3 and
  COLBK all having different values, hence the emulator sometimes modifies
  the colours :-( This option can be enabled during the configuration phase.
- Correction to ANTIC Mode 5 Vertical Scrolling.
- Correction to PMG DMA Code - Demon Attack now works OK.
- Added code to limit the emulator to 50fps - this will not have any
  effect if your machine can't run the emulator greater than 50fps.
  F10 in X11, XVIEW, MOTIF and SVGALIB versions toggles the limit on/off.
  When the limit is off the emulator will go as fast as it can.
- Path to directory containing the OS ROM images is now defined during
  the configuration phase (Declaration of ATARI_LIBRARY has been removed
  from the Makefile).
- Correction to handling of PMG DMA - Pitfall II now Works.
- The unused bits in PMBASE are now ignored correcting errors in Atari Chess
  and Frogger.

Changes in 0.4.5
----------------

- Added a compile time configuration option to control the default
  screen refresh rate. In previous version of the emulator the default
  rate has been 4 frame: draw 1 skip 3. From this version you will
  be prompted for the default during the compile stage (except VMS and
  AMIGA which still default to 4). A value of 1 is required for the
  most accurate emulation. Values other than one can produce some
  collision detection problems on a few programs (e.g. Burried Bucks).
- Split Custom Chip code into seperate files.
- Added 5200 Emulation Code - Runs program but needs modifications to
  support 5200 controllers. The 2K OS ROM must be called "atari5200.rom"
  and placed in the same directory as the other OS ROMS.
- Linux Joystick enabled by configuration program. There are nolonger
  any makefile targets containing "joystick".
- Removed code relating to Emulated Operating System.
- Added option that displays the number of Frames per Second. This option
  is enabled within the configuration program and currently only works
  with the XVIEW version.

Changes in 0.4.4
----------------

- SpartaDOS 3.2 works for both Read and Write Access.
- Alternate Reality "The City" now works.
- Added interrupt timings for Invalid SIO commands.
- Support for Direct Serial I/O Write and Put sectors commands.
- Correction for Double Density ATR files.

Changes in 0.4.3
----------------

- Corrected a Bug that prevented DOS 2.5 from copying files to/from H:
- Re-instated F8 Disk Change function for non XVIEW/MOTIF/AMIGA Systems.

Changes in 0.4.2
----------------

- Test code for faster screen generation, enabled by defining DIRECT_VIDEO
  within "atari_custom.c". It needs a little more thought with respect to
  collision detection, hence it is disabled by default.
- Better PMG Priority Handling.
- Tidied up code accessing hardware registers
- Changed handling of B, D and I flags.
- Changed handling of NMIs.

Changes in 0.4.1
----------------

- Flashes background colour while performing direct Serial I/O
- Minor optimisation to Player/Player collision detection
- Minor changes in CPU emulation
- Correction to new cartridge code causing it to fail under XL/XE
  emulation (Thanks to Neil Shipp)
- New targets in the Makefile for freebsd systems (Thanks to Ivo
  van Poorten)

Changes in 0.4.0
----------------

- Added MOTIF User Interface
- Support for DEC-Windows under VMS (Thanks to Chris F Chiesa)
- Removed dependency on 'ncycles' global variable.
- Support for direct access to serial port hardware - The emulator will
  now run Alternate Reality "The Dungeon" (I haven't tried the others)
- Modified handling of XL/XE memory.
- Fixed the GTIA modes which broke after X Window shared memory support
  was added in version 0.3.0
- Correction allowing Montezumas Revenge to work again.

Changes in 0.3.3
----------------

- New System menu in XVIEW version allowing selection of operating
  system etc.
- Amiga: Iconify working.
- Amiga: System menu contains options for Insert ROM, Remove ROM,
  Enable PILL, Selection of Operating System and all previous disk
  options.
- Amiga: Help menu option is now working using Multiview.

Changes in 0.3.2
----------------

- Modified BRK instruction to take account of the I flag. The BRK
  instruction is ignored if the I flag is set.
- Added all unofficial NOP opcodes.
- New cartridge handling. The XVIEW version provides menu items
  enabling the insertion and removal of cartridges.

Changes in 0.3.1
----------------

- Defined PRINT_COMMAND in devices.c for Amiga
- Minor optimisation to PMG handling
- Modified DLI Handling and ScanLine processing

Changes in 0.3.0
----------------

- Support for Atari 130XE memory banks (Antic currently accesses the
  same bank as the CPU)
- XVIEW Exit item on the Disk menu.
- Printer device calls tmpnam() to allocate a temporary filename for
  the spool file.
- XView version didn't enable HELP key for XL and XE emulation.
- X11 Backspace keys works in the same ways as the Delete key.
  (Thanks to Cyrus Malek)
- Reset and Coldstart now work during XL and XE emulation.
- Added OK button to XVIEW controller and performance dialog boxes.
- Optional support for X11 Shared Memory Images resulting in a 32%
  speed improvement. This option can only be used in conjunction
  with the small screen display. Type make by itself to obtain
  the new list of targets. "-shm" target extension enables this
  option.
- Simple configuration program to avoid editing the Makefile as ofter.
  make will invoke it the first time and afterwards "make config" can
  be used. It currently handles the directories for the H: device, the
  disk image directory for the XVIEW file chooser and the command used
  to send a file to the printer. The print command should contain a %s
  character sequence where a filename is expected (only the first %s
  is relevant).

Changes in 0.2.7
----------------

- Renamed atari_h_device.c to a more general devices.c
- Emulator (private) opcode ESCRTS ($d2) added to support patching of OS.
- Printer device supported via Unix lpr command.
- Moved from RCS to CVS and added rcs Id keyword to all C files.
- Emulated OS: Better handling of Keyboard and ATASCII to screen
  code conversion. Editor uses LMARGN, RMARGN, ROWCRS and COLCRS.
- Many other changes to EmuOS including implementation of SETVBV
  COLDSV and WARMSV.
- Detection of X11 server supporting the MIT Shared Memory Extension in
  preperation for shared memory pixmaps.
- Corrected bug in H: device (filename extraction routine).

Changes in 0.2.6
----------------

- Corrected calculation of number of sectors and reading of double
  density ATR files (Thanks to Preston Crow)
- Correction for Linux ELF systems.
- XVIEW and NAS work under Linux/ELF
- Default directory for XVIEW Disk File Chooser is set within the
  Makefile. By default it is pointing to /usr/local/lib/atari/DISKS
- Corrected bug in Missile 0 to Playfield collision detection.
- Corrected WSYNC bug (multiple stores to WSYNC during one scanline).
  River Raid now runs correctly.
- -emuos to enable emulated operating system. Users without the
  necessary atari OS ROMs can use this option to boot disk images/ROMs.
  Currently this is very experimental and runs very little without
  problems. Defender runs perfectly but if you haven't got the OS it's
  unlikely you'll be able to get this either!
- H0: device accesses the current directory on your Unix Machine.
- H1: through H4: can access four directories specified either within
  the Makefile or via the -H1, -H2, -H3 and -H4 command line options.
  By default they are set to /usr/local/lib/atari/Hx where x is 1, 2,
  3 or 4.
- H5: through H9: duplicate H0 through H4 but have automatic ATASCII
  to ASCII translation. They are not suitable for binary files.
- All files accessed via the H: device have Unix filenames consisting
  entirely of lowercase letters.

Changes in 0.2.5
----------------

- Network Audio System support on Unix Systems [incl. Linux]. Waveform
  can be selected via the -sinewave or -squarewave options. At the
  moment it doesn't support the Atari Distortion values and switches
  channels using distortion off. This is available in XVIEW, X Window
  and Linux SVGALIB versions. The Network Audio System is freely
  available on the Internet - I used nas-1.2p2.tar.gz. Any Linux XVIEW
  version do not work when built with the Network Audio System.
  *** See BUGS file for more information ***
- Support for /dev/sequencer removed since it didn't look like it
  would ever produce satisfactory results.
- Introduced -help option that lists all options available in the
  emulator.
- Added LAX unofficial opcodes
- Corrected Vertical Fine scrolling in Antic Mode 7.
- Enhanced DLIST command in "monitor.c" which now displays the display
  list using mnemonics.
- Updated VMS command file.

Changes in 0.2.4
----------------

- Corrected mask in Atari800_GetByte() and Atari800_PutByte()
- In Atari800_PutByte(), only switch on cartridge type when an
  access is made to page $d5
- Screen generation using word access where possible.
- merged main.c with atari.c
- Fixed SVGALIB Escape and cursor keys.
- Emulated Floating Point Library which performs floating point
  arithmetic directly on your host computer - bypasses 6502 CPU
  emulation. Enabled by the -ffp option.

Changes in 0.2.3
----------------

- ADC and SBC functions are nolonger implemented as functions.
- 6502 PC, S, A, X, and Y register now handled using local
  variables. Copied to global variables on exit from cpu and
  restored on re-entry.
- Took advantage of a GCC feature: goto array[opcode]. Other compilers
  still use a switch statement.
- Amiga: DisplayScreen() tidied up
- Added DLIST command to monitor. This command shows the address of
  the display list (from hardware registers).
- Major recode of all Antic Graphics Modes. Now allows Horizontal and
  Vertial fine scrolling.
- Added an -interlace option to the SVGALIB version, giving a
  performance increase of about 10%. You would use this option to
  increase the speed of programs that must be run with a screen
  refresh rate of 1 (e.g. Burried Bucks)
- In the SVGALIB version, the F11 and F12 keys can be used to modify
  the vertical positioning of the emulated screen. F11 moves the screen
  down while F12 moves the screen up.
- Corrected a BUG causing River Raid to have corrupt screen display.

Changes in 0.2.2
----------------

- Made GetByte, GetWord and PutByte macros local to cpu.c
- Added some 386 inline asm() for some 6502 addressing modes
- Simplified Keyboard Handling
- Assembly routines for Amiga AGA screen handling

Changes in 0.2.1
----------------

- Created a new Makefile for Unix. The Amiga support is now in
  Makefile.amiga
- Sorry, but I renamed the ATARI800 environment variable to ATARI_LIBRARY
  which points to /usr/local/lib/atari by default.
- Control + Shift + Key combination for Linux SVGALIB implementation.
- SVGALIB version can be restarted after entering the monitor.
- HELP Key available in XL/XE mode
- Optional XVIEW (V3) Interface for X Window version. Allows disk changes
  using a file selector, controller configuration and access to performance
  variables.
- BREAK Key fixed
- PC Joysticks can be used with Linux (svgalib, x11 and xview) through the
  /dev/js0 and /dev/js1 devices. Second button activates the space bar
  which is very useful in Defender :-) Build with "make <system>" where
  <system> is one of:- linux-x11-joystick, linux-xview-joystick or
  linux-svgalib-joystick
- X11 Joystick emulation using keyboard re-implemented. Straight X11 can
  use either numeric keypad or cursor keys + space. XVIEW can only use
  cursor keys + space (Problem using keypad in xview!)
- Disk selector for Amiga version + controller configuration menu
- Started code to emulate SERIN and SEROUT registers. At the moment this
  is ongoing and does not work. New startup option -nopatch disables the
  SIO patch leaving the normal SIO routine in place.

Changes in 0.2.0
----------------

- Separated Playfield Scanlines from Player Missile Scanlines
- Corrected playfield colour errors in Antic modes 8 & 10
- Horizontal Fine Scrolling
- Playfield and Player/Missile Priorities
- Allow Emulator to run either as an Amiga Screen or Window
- Added Paddle support for Amiga

Changes in 0.1.9
----------------

- Corrected bug in IRQST and IRQEN
- Corrected minor bug in player missile collision detection
- Amiga version is now full screen + Menus
- Faster disk I/O
- Added ATARI800 environment variable. This allows the emulator to be
  run from different directories. If ATARI800 is unset it will still
  try to load the OS images from object/ below the current working
  directory.
- colours.h replaces colours.dat
- Added man page.
- New way of handling Joysticks, Triggers, Paddles and Console Keys
- Corrected handling of CHBASE which was causing K-RAZY ANTIKS to
  display garbage.
- Corrected handling of VCOUNT which was causing screen handling
  errors in Star Raiders (galactic map) and Henri (game screen).
- Added Sound API. A test sound implementation is available for
  the Linux SVGALIB version via /dev/sequencer - It's not very good
  and has only been used to test the API. It is enabled by starting
  the program with the -sound option. Listen to the title screens
  of Necromancer, K-Razy Antiks and Henri (these are the best
  I've heard).
- argc and argv are passed to the platform specific initialisation
  code - Atari_Initialise(). This allows platform specific options
  like -sound on the Linux SVGALIB version.
- Extra Amiga options -ocs -ecs and -aga. Currently the default is
  AGA. The -ocs and -ecs have been tested on an A1200 with the
  OCS and ECS emulation modes enabled. At the moment it is not
  guaranteed to work on real OCS or ECS equiped machines since it
  has only been tested under Workbench 3.0. Hopefully someone will
  provide some feedback.
- Another two Amiga options -grey and -colour. The -grey option
  produces a grey scale display on OCS, ECS and AGA machines. The
  -colour option produces a full colour display on AGA machines and
  up to 32 simultaneous colours on OCS and ECS machines.
- The DOUBLE_SIZE compilation flag for the X11 version has been
  replaced by a runtime options. The runtime options are -small,
  -large and -huge.

Changes in 0.1.8
----------------

- Allows direct use of GRAFP0, GRAFP1, GRAFP2, GRAFP3 and GRAFM without
  using DMA.
- -rom16 option to load standard 16K ROMs.
- -a option to load object/atariosa.rom
- -b [default] option to load object/atariosb.rom
- Simplified screen generation for host - Player missile graphics
  collision detection has been moved into 'atari_custom.c'
- Corrected read from PORTB (XL/XE emulation)
- GTIA support for *all* antic modes.
  i.e. GTIA can be enabled in graphics mode 0 (antic mode 2) just like
       a real 800. POKE 623 with 64, 128 or 192 to test.
- Amiga version can be compiled using either DICE C or GNU C - see Makefile

Changes in 0.1.7
----------------

- Issue cpu cycles during screen update (corrects VCOUNT problem)
    As a result DLI are not occuring on the correct mode line.
- Support for 256 bytes/sector ATR files
- Handle Insert, Delete and Tab keys properly
- Handle Shift + Control + A-Z properly (X11 only)
- Cartridge support tidied up (Thanks to Dave Bennett)

Changes in 0.1.6
----------------

- Correct Colours (Thanks to Chris Lam)
- Fetch correct number of screen bytes with horizontal scrolling enabled
- Speed improvements for Antic Display Modes
- Support for ATR files (128 bytes sectors only)
- Support for XL/XE ROM (Reset etc. do not work???)
- Corrected Bug in BCD SBC instruction.
- Added X11 window Expose event (Thanks to Ivo van Poorten)
- Control characters within CURSES (Thanks to Ivo van Poorten)
- Improved Portability
- Remove '-b' flag (Use -rom object/ataribas.rom instead)
- Graphical Support for Amiga 1200
- Faster 6502 Emulation
- X11 Joystick emulation now uses the mouse

Changes in 0.1.5
----------------

- CURSES text only mode (Support for various terminals)
- Display list jump instruction corrected.
- Fixed SIO module (It didn't update DSTATS)

Changes in 0.1.4
----------------

- Changed GetByte and PutByte to macros
- Added SVGALIB support for Linux which is much quicker than X11.
- Added support for OSS Super Cartridges (Thanks to Dave Bennett)
- -rom option to specify alternative cartridges
- -oss option to specify alternative OSS Super Cartridges

Changes in 0.1.3
----------------

- Compilation option for double size screen
- Trigger now initialises to not pressed
- Joystick now initialises to central
- Fifth Player support added
- Support for Paddle 0
- Preparation for changing GetByte and PutByte to macros.

Changes in 0.1.2
----------------

- Now include <stdlib.h>  in atari_custom.h

- Resets count to countdown as soon as it reaches zero. This was causing
  problems with the RESET Key - count went negative.

- Removed XImage structure. I am now updating only the pixels that have
  changed within a Pixmap. XCopyArea is used to move the Pixmap onto
  the Window. XCopyArea is not called if no pixels are changed. As a
  result I am trying a higher refresh rate.

- Correction for BASIC version - I left some X11 stuff in resulting in
  unresolved sybols.

- Remove unused status variable from atari_h_device.c

- Added some test Amiga Intuition Code - not usable (No Colour or Keyboard)
  It manages to get the 'READY' prompt up! Atari Basic Blue is one colour
  and everything else is the other. When keyboard support is added you
  will be able to use Atari Basic.

- Registers are now allocated variables within atari_custom.c. They are
  nolonger stored in main memory area.

Changes in 0.1.1 
----------------

- Outputs an error message when ROM images are not available.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

- Initial Release
