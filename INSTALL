Installation of the Atari 800 Emulator
--------------------------------------

Irrespective of whether you are going to compile the emulator yourself
or install a pre-compiled binary version you must obtain a copy of the
Operating System ROMs.

The ROMs images are distributed within the PC Xformer 2.5 package (other
versions of this program do not contain the ROMs in a suitable format)
which can be downloaded from:-

Site:      ftp.doc.ic.ac.uk
Directory: /computing/systems/atari/umich/8bit/Xf2
File:      xf25.zip

Note: Check your usual UMICH mirror first or do an archie search on
      xf25

An environment variable "ATARI_LIBRARY" must be created which points
towards the directory that will contain the OS ROM images.

Copy the *.rom files extracted from PC-Xformer into the directory
specified by "ATARI_LIBRARY".

If you are creating the ROM images yourself they should be called:-

1. ataribas.rom (8192 bytes between $a000 and $bfff)
2. atariosa.rom (10240 bytes between $d800 and $ffff)
3. atariosb.rom (10240 bytes between $d800 and $ffff)
4. atarixl.rom (16384 bytes between $c000 and $ffff)

Note: If you are extracting the atarixl.rom you will find that the
      ROM area under the custom chip ($d000 to $d7ff) are mapped
      between $5000 and $57ff when bit 7 of PORTB is set to 1.

      i.e. You should set bit 7 of PORTB and then dump the memory
           out in the following order:- $c000 to $cfff, $5000 to $57ff
           and finally $d800 to $ffff.

You must have at least one of "atariosa.rom", "atariosb.rom" and
"atarixl.rom". "ataribas.rom" is needed if you intend running
basic programs (I would suggest you keep it just in case).

If you have obtained a binary distribution you should be able to start
it by executing the atari800 program.

Note: for case sensitive systems make sure that the filenames and
      directory are all lowercase.

5200 Emulation
--------------

If you can obtain a copy of the 2K Atari 5200 OS ROM it must be called
"atari5200.rom" and placed in the directory specified by "ATARI_LIBRARY".

Compiling the Emulator
----------------------

The emulator can be compiled for the following systems (and probably
many others with a little work):-

1. X Window Version (Including SUN OpenWindows) on a Unix Platform
2. SVGALIB Version on Linux
3. CURSES version for UNIX
4. Graphical Version for the Amiga
5. BASIC version (No Graphics). Should be straightforward to configure
   for any 32 bit environment supporting ANSI C.

   Note: I don't say 32 bit computer because certain operating systems
   enforce a 16 bit memory model. No prizes are offered for correctly
   identifing the OS in question.

Building the Emulator on a Unix Platform
----------------------------------------

1. Type "make" for a list of supported platforms.
2. Select the most appropriate platform and type "make <platform>"
   for instance if you want the linux svgalib version you would type
   "make linux-svgalib"
3. Install the emulator by typing "make install". If you are building
   one of the linux svgalib versions then you should login as root
   and type "make install-svgalib" this is because svgalib programs
   need to be run setuid root.

Building the Emulator for Curses
--------------------------------

Follow the instruction for Unix but note that you must be using the
System V Curses Library. BSD Curses is lacking a few functions and
will not work (nodelay, attron, attroff, keypad and curs_set).

Building the Emulator for VAX/VMS
---------------------------------

This version only support the BASIC text only mode. You will be
able to run programs such as:- DOS 2.5, DOS XL, MAC65 (disk version),
Atari Basic and similar programs. I have had reports that you can
make the X11 version run under DEC-Windows with a little work.

Note: I have not built this version for a while. Modifications may be
      required to vmsbuild.

To build type @vmsbuild at the command line. I have compiled it with
GNU C 2.6.1 but I don't expect problems with other versions. It
will probably compile OK on VAX C but it will require the appropriate
compilation options to be inserted into vmsbuild.com

atari800 :== $DISK$xxxx:[yyyy]atari800.exe

	where xxxx is the disk the software is on.
	      yyyy is the directory the software is in.

Building the Emulator for the CBM Amiga
---------------------------------------

Compiler: GNU C + DICE C (Lattice C Untried)

There is a separate makefile provided for the Amiga - Makefile.amiga
By default it is setup for use with GCC. If you are using Dice C you
will need to comment out the GCC section and remove the comments from
the Dice section. Unfortunately I don't use DICE C very often so if
it no longer compiles please let me know.

GNU C is available on AMINET under dev/gcc but needs about 6MB to
compile the emulator.

For GCC be sure that the C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable is
pointing to the location of the official Commodore include files
prior to compiling the emulator.

For example:
	setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH /path/of/cbm/includes
